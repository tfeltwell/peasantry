Peasantry v0.1

Experience life as a 17th century European peasant. This is 
the story much less known, and much more interesting.

Peasantry revolves around survival of yourself and your family,
through subsistence farming and rearing animals. Dealing with
you manorial/feudal lords and their ruinous demands will also 
feature heavily. 

Note: Game is currently still in development, so definitely
considered pre-alpha.

Developer's note: This has been massively inspired by games such
as Unreal World RPG and Dwarf Fortress, in terms of the intensive
simulation and the deep and faithful (in URW anyway) historical
representation.
